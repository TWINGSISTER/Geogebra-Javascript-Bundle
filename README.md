# Geogebra-Javascript-Bundle
Provides Javascript codebase for the Geogebra project

This repository takes the master branch of 
[the official Geogebra repository](https://github.com/geogebra/geogebra) and builds, via GitHub Actions, the Javascript codebase for the web version of Geogebra. The code here is generated using GWT starting from the Java codebase of Geogebra. The Geogebra codebase is made available under the  copyright detailed in the license [here](https://stage.geogebra.org/license). The goal of this repository is to provide extended building facilities for this application using GitHub Actions. Building will be extended to provide a non obfuscated Javascript codebase for the Geogebra applet. 

This is part of a project comprising other two repositories in order to collect a large number of Geogebra self evaluated, multilingual,  tests for high school Mathematics and Physics, to be used within Moodle.
